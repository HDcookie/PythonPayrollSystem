A project we have worked on in my CIS202 class.  

When you run, you set it up as a terminal.  It either is a time clock terminal, or a management terminal.  Time clock let's employees clock in and out, and saves the recorded hours when the clock out.  Management terminal will let management create checks for every user and reset their hours, or add a employee record to the system.  

# TODO for this cource
- Let management remove users
- Fix some menus not returning to previous menu and instead exiting the program.  

# Possible TODO
- Migrate to a database that records more data than just for that period, as well as manageing data more easily.
